This process wants to exit.
Need to clean up the process structure and the thread structure.

Does the process have a parent?
	If no, then what?
		then there are no threads waiting for it with waitpid. The parent must have exited, or it never had a parent.
		Since only parents are allowed to wait on children, then we can safely remove the process entirely.
			1) Give up the PID
			2) Forget the process entirely
	If yes, then what?
		then, we check if that parent is still running, or if it exited. 
		If it's running, there CAN be some processes waiting for this thread to finish. Since it has a parent, and parents need to always be able to get the exit code with waitpid,
		we must exit the process, clean it up, but leave a memory of it in the process table.
		If the parent is exited, then we do same thing as if it had no parent, because the exited parent will never wait for it's child.

Either way, we notify the "waiting" threads that are waiting for this process to end with a waitpid call.
All waitpid calls should wait for the thread to exit on a CV for that thread. The exiting process should broadcast to all threads on this CV.

Waitpid waits for a process to exit. One of several things could happen here.
First, we need to find out what the process is actually doing. We get the process by it's PID.

If the process doesn't exist at all, then waitpid fails. Can this even happen? In our case, probably not.
If the process exists, then we check if the current process is the parent of the process we retrieved. If not, waitpid fails. 
If the process exists and is the child of the current process
	but is already exited, then we just return the exit status, and we're all good.
	but is still running,
		then we need wait for it to finish running, and inform us when it has done doing so
			We need to mark that we're interested in the process (process interest count ++?)
			We need to wait on the processes CV while the process is still running

Fork needs to :

We use a semaphore because start_child does all the work so only fork needs to wait on start_child.
This is done via the fork_info structure to create a means of communication between the two functions.
Since start_child needs to copy data from the parent thread and the fork_info is defined in the fork stack frame, we need fork to wait until start_child is done.
Fork does not care about start_child afterwards because the only thing it's interested in is the generated PID which is saved with the fork_info.
